When I first started learning programming, there were quite a few basic concepts that I struggled with over and over. Now that I've been working in web development for a year, I feel like I want to share how I understand some of them. Hopefully others will find the explanations a little useful too!

So here's an incomplete list of topics I want to write about. 
- variable scope
- function arguments
- callback functions
- classes (and inheritance) in PHP and JS
- DNS records
- Wordpress actions and filters
- quite a lot of html and css
